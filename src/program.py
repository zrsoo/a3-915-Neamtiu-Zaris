# domain section is here (domain = numbers, transactions, expenses, etc.)
# getters / setters
# No print or input statements in this section
# Specification for all non-trivial functions (trivial usually means a one-liner)


# Functionalities section (functions that implement required features)
# No print or input statements in this section
# Specification for all non-trivial functions (trivial usually means a one-liner)
# Each function does one thing only
# Functions communicate using input parameters and their return values


# UI section
# (all functions that have input or print statements, or that CALL functions with print / input are  here).
# Ideally, this section should not contain any calculations relevant to program functionalities

print('Hello A3')


# Test functions go here
#
# Test functions:
#   - no print / input
#   - great friends with assert

def test_init(test_list):
    # use this function to add the 10 required items
    # use it to set up test data
    pass
